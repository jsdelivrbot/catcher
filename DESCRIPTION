Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(
    person("Chris", "Hua", email = "chua@wharton.upenn.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
  )
Description: Caches results of functions on disk, and automagically
    accesses them from disk when the function is called again. Especially
    useful when downloading files from database/web, or running expensive
    computations. Includes numerous options that data scientists will find
    useful with managing their cache.
